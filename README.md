## About The Project


The Project has been created to implement an Authentication System using JWT with the use of the Postgres Database. I've used Prisma ORM to manage the querying & migrates of the database.
Uploady support files that can be shared with others using Supabase Storage as Bucket similar to Amazon S3 Buckets.
